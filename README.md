# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a fun twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, adding extra layers of strategy and challenge. Instead of one simple 3×3 grid, the game is played on a large 3×3 grid where each cell itself contains a smaller 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board!

## How to Play?
- The game starts with Player Blue.
- Each turn, you place your mark (blue or red) in one of the small cells on a small board.
- The small board you play in determines where your opponent must play next:
- Example: If you play in the top-left cell of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-left small board on the big grid.
- If the targeted small board has already been won or is full, your opponent may choose any small board to play in.
- The goal is to win three small boards in a row on the big grid — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

 ## Technologies Used
- HTML / CSS for the design
- Javascript to intact dynamic change onto the UI
- Python (Flask) for logic
